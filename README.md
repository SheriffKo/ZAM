# ZAM

ZAM is my small Python project, created for personal use for me and my friend. If you want, you can use it too - although for the average user it is not very useful. For now.

All you (usually?) need to do is run the program as an administrator and click the "Run" button. In theory, the program will automatically find the root directory of your server folder (for example, C:\Users\User\Zomboid\mods), as well as the download folder of the steam workshop mods. If this does not happen, then you will be asked to enter the path manually. Then the program will create symbolic links for you comfortably, WITHOUT DUPLICATING or CHANGING the mods. In essence, this is a simplified redirect.

A preliminary version with working basic functionality - collect links from all Zomboid Project Steam mods in your subscriptions in one folder, and also easily update or delete them. First of all, this is needed for server hosts who have a license for the game. Then maybe I can do something about it.
